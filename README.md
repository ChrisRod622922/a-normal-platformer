## Welcome to the Official Page for A Normal Platformer!
This game is a typical platformer that increasingly gets difficult as you progress. To download the latest ZIP, [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/ChrisRod622922/a-normal-platformer/archive/master.zip). If you would like to download the Windows executable file, CLICK HERE.

### Story
You awake in a limbo world riddled with enemies and strange gems, lit only by the mysterious nightsky and lamps that light the path to an unknown destination. As the player, you must progress to the very end in hopes of escaping the limbo.

### How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the player (LEFT and RIGHT to move in the horizontal direction and UP to jump). To pause the game, press 'p'. To restart the game from the beginning, press 'r'. To exit the game, press the ESCAPE (ESC) key.

In order to win the game, your score must equal 0. This is accomplished by acquiring all of the yellow gems scattered throughout each level. Be careful, however, because one encounter with an enemy or a pitfall will result in a loss and the game will restart.
